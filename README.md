# Tailwind CSS Webpack Starter Project

This is an example of a super simple Webpack setup for using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

After that, start up Webpack:

```
npm run watch
```

Webpack will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.

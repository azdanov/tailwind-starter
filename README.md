# Tailwind CSS Webpack Starter Project

This is an example of a super simple Webpack setup for using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/).

```sh
# Install using npm
npm i

# Install using Yarn
yarn

# For development with webpack watch:
npm run watch

# For unminified and purged dev build:
npm run dev

# For minified and purged production build:
npm run prod
```

Webpack will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.
